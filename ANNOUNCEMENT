Introducing Q-Lite 0.0.6.0
I’m excited to announce the official release of **Qlite**, a modular Python-based Quantum Compiler and Simulator! Quantum programming often feels locked behind complex setups. I built *Qlite Language* to bridge that gap—providing a lightweight, full-stack environment that goes from high-level source code to hardware-ready OpenQASM.
## Key Features:
 * *Macro Expansion*: Use high-level commands like QFT q[0:3] and let the compiler handle the heavy lifting.
 * *Local Simulator*: Test your logic instantly with a NumPy-powered state-vector engine.
 * *Hardware Ready*: Transpile your designs into OpenQASM for execution on real quantum computers.
 * *Developer Friendly*: A clean CLI that fits right into your existing workflow.

Qlite is now available on PyPI and is fully Open Source under the MIT License.

Check it out on my GitHub repository: [qlite](https://GitHub.com/MAX25M/Qlite)

Install it today: 
```pip install qlite-compiler```
